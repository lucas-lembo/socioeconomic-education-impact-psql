## Database Schema Overview

The initial phase of our project involved developing both the conceptual and relational models of our relational database (PostgreSQL).
This foundation enabled us to analyze the relationships between school SAEB scores, IDEB (Basic Education Development Index) scores,
students' socioeconomic levels, and the geographical locations of these schools (capital, interior, rural, urban).
